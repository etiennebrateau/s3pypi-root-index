# S3PyPI Root Index

[S3PyPI][s3pypi] creates an index page for each package's files, but not an index for the list of packages themselves at
the repository root. This tool uses S3PyPI internals to create such an index.

Note that there is also [a PR][pr26] to add similar functionality directly to S3PyPI.
